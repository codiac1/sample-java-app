# Sample Springboot APP

### Building and Running the Application Locally

**1. Navigate to the project directory:**

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```

**2. Package the application (this will create a ROOT.jar file in the target directory):**

```bash
mvn clean package
```

**3. Run the JAR file:**
```bash
java -jar target/ROOT.jar
```

By following these steps, you will rename your final JAR file to ROOT.jar and be able to run it locally.
